# CavernVoxeliser
Defining structural geometry around scanned mesh of Mulu Cave in Borneo. 

Structural units are 'voxels' that are located based on intersections with the scanned mesh, plus additional units to complete trussess and provide vertical support.

Using RhinoCommon for intersections and trimming with meshes, breps and planes.

Set up here to output to grasshopper but classes are defined as independent objects for use elsewhere.
